# Shor's Algorithm For Factorization

In this project I decided to implement from scratch the Shor's algorithm for factorization for quantum computation. 

The algorithm is based on five important concept:

- Quantum Fourier Transformation
- Phase Estimation
- Order Finding
- Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation
- Continued Fraction Expansion

All the procedure to build the algorithm is entirely and deeply discussed in the PDF inside the `doc` folder.

The entire code as a python module is contained in the `quantum` folder

A notebook to explain both textual and figurative each step is contained in the `notebooks` folder.

## Conclusion

The code is entirely public. For any addition or improvements feel free to ask and make pull requests.
